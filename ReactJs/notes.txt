If you consider frontend as independent layer which would work without backend 
so we can create frontend application which can hit an api which returns a fake 
response and that make sures that our application is able to make request and get the responses back 
and once you have the respnse you able to pass it visualise it and do n number of different activities 
that you want to do with any web application


============================================Course Framework============================================

First create an application using reactJs which will make basically API call make all file systems call and
all other thins to get he response back and perform the activities on its own as an individual web application

We extend same crud application to invoke backend call, here invoking backend call means that we will create express 
api and points and deploy on node and make our react application to call those APIs.

at this point we are not going to call the databse but again we are going to fake the responses back to frontend from the middleware

Once we are done with middleware development or basically learning node and express next we will learn how to create to create mongoDB create the cluster create the schemas
and we are going to extend the application to express api to call the database
